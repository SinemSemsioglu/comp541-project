# comp541-project
Project repository for comp 541 - Machine Learning class. Will include implementation of CDBN's in Knet.

As a class project I will be working on the implementation of 
[Unsupervised learning of hierarchical representations with convolutional deep belief networks](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rajeshr/papers/cacm2011-researchHighlights-convDBN.pdf) by Honglak Lee, Roger Grosse, Rajesh Ranganath, and Andrew Y. Ng. In this paper they introduce Convolutional Deep Belief Networks. My implementation will be written in [Julia](http://docs.julialang.org) with the deep learning framework [Knet](https://denizyuret.github.io/Knet.jl/latest).

More coming soon!
